        <p style="font-size:250%">I have explored the idea of abstract works and making art fun and wonky. There are a few
        pieces around that show how serious--and not serious--art can be. Art can be something you create <a href="intro.html">digitally</a> 
            and you change its form. It can be art you <a href="texture.html">create</a> in digital alone. It can also be art 
            inside a <a href="echo.html">photgraph</a> you take of nature or something that's caught your eye. Follow along with me as we 
            explore different concepts and ideas about art and make our own adventures.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       </p>
