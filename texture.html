        </h1>
        <p>Even from one page to the next, our minds are moving 
            so fast that information is constantly gaining and dumping. 
            It picks out what is useful and gets rid of the rest. I'm sure on 
            the last page you noticed some letters were capitalized. Can you remember
            what the 2 letters were without going back to look? Probably not.</p>

        <p>If you live your life enjoying every memory you make and spending time dwelling on the most important ones. 
        You'll be able to help yourself in remembering what matters most and keeping the memories working, even if they 
        change over time.</p>
